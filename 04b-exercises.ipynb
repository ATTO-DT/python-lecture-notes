    "You can load a list of numbers using one of several methods. For example, you can load a list of integers like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "L = list()\n",
    "n = int(input(\"The number of list elements: \"))\n",
    "for k in range(n):\n",

    "#x = load_a_list_of_ints()\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After your code works properly for that one example, you can try a few more by changing the value of `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, remove or comment out the fixed value of `x`:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "Of course, the same approach can be used with the other input methods that we've seen in lectures. Furthermore, the `break` statement (which we shall see later on) in some of those can be replaced with `return L`."

This is the same algorithm that you use when searching for something in a *sorted* index at the end of a book: look at the middle term and decide where to look next (to the left or the right) and proceed until the element is found or you realize that it doesn't exist. Each step cuts the number of candidates in half (so, a list with $2^{\\color{red}{10}} = 1024$ elements is searched in at most $\\color{red}{10}$ steps).\n",
