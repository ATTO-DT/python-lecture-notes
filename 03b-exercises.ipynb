Assign the appropriate default values for any of the parameters for which it makes sense to do so.\n",

A function in Python (and most other modern languages) can invoke itself just like it can invoke any other function. However, there are two major things to remember:\n",

So, if a function that invokes itself has a parameter `x`, then there will be two variables `x` in the memory, each belonging to its own invocation.
