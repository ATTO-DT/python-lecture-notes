This is a nice example of a mathematical \"trickery\" used to improve the complexity, but it will not be a part of any examination. Also, notice that this algorithm can improve the computation even if the list is not sorted, since the sorting itself can be done in $O(n\\log n)$ time, which is faster that $O(n^2)$ required by the naive \"by the definition\" algorithm."
