    "A [*flow network*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_network) is a directed graph in which every arc (a directed edge) has a real-numbered, nonnegative *capacity*, and in which two nodes are distinguished from the others: the *source* (a node in which no arcs enter) and the *sink* (a node which no arcs leave). Here is an example of a flow:\n",

    "1. we never overflow the capacity of any of the edges, and\n",
    "\n",
    "2. each node except the source and the sink recieves and sends the same amount of *something* (i.e., nothing is retained nor created).\n",
    "\n",
    "This has a plethora of applications in modeling of electrical networks, internet traffic, public transportation, water supply networks, transportation of goods, international travel, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common questions here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the capacity of the network, i.e., how much can we send from the source to the sink?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the weak links in the network, i.e., where can we improve the network?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to the first one is the [maximum flow of the network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem), while the answer to the second one is its *minimum cut* (the set of edges of the minimum total capacity that, when cut, split the graph in two or more unconnected components). Incidentally, [these two are the same](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max-flow_min-cut_theorem). For the above flow, the minimum cut is marked on the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Minimum cut](11c-flow-min_cut.png)\n",
