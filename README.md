# Programming with Python (MATH20622)

## Lecture notes from the course taught at the [University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/) in the academic year 2014/15.

Notes:

The exercises are meant to be solved at home, prior to lab classes. Lab classes problems are meant to be solved by students during the lab classes (and finished at home), but you are welcome to try them at home as well.

The standard form for the name of the solution files is "name-xx-yy.py". Those files that have additional parts in their names are aimed at the students interested in more advanced programming, usually incorporating more than what is covered by the materials so far, and – as such – will not be part of that week's tests.

For example, the files named in the form "name-xx-yy-py.py" are so called "Pythonic solutions" that use more advanced Python constructs (some of which will be covered in the later lectures).

Each solution has a short description in its docstring, emphasising when it is not a "standard" solution.
