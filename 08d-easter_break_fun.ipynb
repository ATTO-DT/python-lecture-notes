    "  * If input is 4, loads the filter values (those defined by the `filter` function) and deletes the matches; if all the filters are left empty, it doesn't delete anything (this is what `clear` is for);\n",
    "  * If input is 5, offers the list of possible keys and sorts the data according to the user's pick;\n",
    "  * If input is 6, asks for a filename and saves the data;\n",
    "  * If input is 7, asks for a filename and loads the data (the old data is lost);\n",
    "  * If input is 8, same as 7, but the newly read data is appended to the old data (i.e., the old data is NOT lost);\n",
