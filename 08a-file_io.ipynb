    "> Write a program that maintains students' scores in this course. The program has to allow adding students, editing their data (adding scores, for example), sorting and filtering the data, export to the web, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a pretty standard request (obviously, written in a very abbreviated fashion). But inputing all the students' info each time we want to do anything with it is just not feasible: we need to save the data, using a more permanent medium than the working memory. This is usually a disk, and this is where the files come into play."

    "## Where to save the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, we save the data directly to files. We open them, write to them, and close them.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are requests that go beyond just saving data to files. For example, Google cannot fit the list of all the web pages on the internet on a single computer, let alone in one file. Similarly, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and many other big services have simply too much data to fit them to a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, *databases* are used. At the lowest level, these are still files, but we do not access them as such. Instead, specialized programs and modules -- so called *database engines* -- are used to access this data. They have their specific ways of use, which fall outside of the scope of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "More interested students are welcome to read more on the subject themselves at the various sources available on the internet. A good and fairly short introduction is [Python Programming/Databases](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Databases), with examples in some widely used database systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) writes its data in a single file, as it is meant for smaller applications (for example, Chrome and Firefox are using it). Other systems usually work with several files per database and, more importantly, require a separate installation of the database engine. In other words, [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)/[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) (almost the same engine) will not work with just Python installed. In order to use them, you also need their respective database engines.\n",

    "Compared to the working memory (RAM), disks are very slow. For that and some technical reasons, the data is rarely saved directly to a disk at the same moment that a program tells Python to save it. Instead, the operating system will store the data in a *buffer* (a part of the memory reserved for this purpose), postponing the actual disk writing until an opportune moment (usually until enough data is sent for saving).\n",

Examples include $\\LaTeX$ documents, source codes (for example, Python programs), HTML pages (including style and script files), and anything else made with text editors like [(g)vim](http://www.vim.org/), [(X)Emacs](http://www.xemacs.org/), [Notepad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_%28software%29), [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Spyder](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/ide_integration.html#spyder), etc.  \n",
    "  Note that, generally, this does not include documents written with Microsoft Word and other text processors.  \n",
    "  For text files, the buffer is usually flushed whenever a new line is started.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Binary files* are closer to the way the data is stored in the computer's working memory. They are typically used for various media files (images, movies, music, etc), data collections (for example, ZIP, RAR, and similar archives), and some formated documents (for example, older versions of Word documents)."
