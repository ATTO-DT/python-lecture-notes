    "\n",
    "To create a random labyrinth with `r` rows and `c` columns, first create a grid graph with $r \\times c$ nodes, assigning each of the edges a random weight, like this:\n",
    "![Basic graph as a grid](12c-pil/test-graph.png)\n",
    "The nodes represent the blocks in the labyrinth, while the edges represent the possible locations for the walls or the openings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then compute its [minimum spanning tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) $T$ using [one of these NetworkX functions](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/algorithms.mst.html):\n",
    "![Spanning tree; the edges define halls](12c-pil/test-tree.png)\n",
    "Notice that the spanning tree defines the halls of our labyrinth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random weights ensure that we get different minimum spanning trees for different graphs, and the fact that we are using trees ensures that there are no cycles while the graph/labyrinth remains connected (i.e., there is exactly one path between each pair of blocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "All that we need to do now is draw this as a labyrinth, using PIL's [<tt>ImageDraw.Draw.rectangle</tt> function](http://effbot.org/imagingbook/imagedraw.htm#tag-ImageDraw.Draw.rectangle). You can also use the [<tt>ImageDraw.Draw.line</tt> function](http://effbot.org/imagingbook/imagedraw.htm#tag-ImageDraw.Draw.line), but this will give you less control over how the walls are drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we need to draw the walls of the labyrinth, while our tree contains its halls, i.e., we need to draw the walls corresponding with the grey edges on the previous image. This means that we need to draw a wall between neightbour blocks $(f,t)$ if and only if $(f,t)$ is **not** and edge in $T$. This might seem like a job for a [complement graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_graph) (implemented as [<tt>networkx.complement</tt>](http://networkx.lanl.gov/archive/networkx-1.1/reference/generated/networkx.complement.html)), but it is not, because the complement graph would also contain the edges between the non-neighbour nodes. However, a simple `if edge not in tree.edges()` does the trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to solve the labyrinth?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to generate the solution of the labyrinth, choose two blocks for the enterance and the exit, and find the path between them inside the tree $T$. This path is unique, but NetworkX doesn't have a \"find the unique path in a tree\" functon. However, it does have various [shortest path functions](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/algorithms.shortest_paths.html) which will do the job. For our example, such path looks like this:\n",
    "![Minimum path, defining the solution](12c-pil/test-path.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, all that is left is drawing this solution on the previously drawn image of the labyrinth.\n",
